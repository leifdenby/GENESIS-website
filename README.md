# GENESIS project website

Hi! You are looking at the source code for the [GENESIS project
website](http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earlcd/GENESIS/). If you have any
additions you'd like to make please make a pull request.

The site is built on top of [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) which is a super
lightweight static site generator.

Cheers,  
Leif
